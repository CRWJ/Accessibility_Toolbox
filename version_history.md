## Version History
- ```v2.2``` added the *OD Cost Matrix to Parquet Dataset* tool
  - the Parquet format is [great](https://www.upsolver.com/blog/apache-parquet-why-use)! No more `.csv`'s!
  - and fixed the `od_lines` referenced before assignment error that arises when a particular batch returns no results
- ```v2.1``` added the *OD Cost Matrix Calculator for ArcGIS Pro 2.4 Multiprocessing* for the rapid calculation of raw origin-destination cost matrices
  - takes full advantage of your multi-core PC
  - joins back in the original origins ID for further analysis
  - note - the final merge of all the worker matrices might take a while for very large analyses with billions of rows as this operation is still single-threaded
- ```v2.0``` the *Accessibility Calculator* for ArcGIS Pro has been entirely rewritten and is now **4 to 5 times faster**
  - introduced a new version of the tool called *Accessibility Calculator Pro MP* for ArcGIS Pro 2.4 or above that takes advantage of **parallel processing** and data access cursors for dramatic improvements in processing time
  - main functions are now moved to the ```access_calc_main.py``` file which can be run from either the Python toolbox or command line
  - impedance parameters are now stored in their own separate ```parameters.py``` file and streamlined for easy editing
  - the tool now includes ```.xml``` files for help pop-ups in the geoprocessing window
  - the *Accessibility Calculator* for ArcGIS 10x and earlier versions of ArcGIS Pro have been moved to the ```legacy_tools``` folder
- ```v1.1``` altered the *Accessibility Calculator* for 10x and Pro:
  - introduced a new version of the *Accessibility Calculator for ArcGIS Pro 2.4* that uses the new [arcpy.nax](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/network-analyst/what-is-the-network-analyst-module.htm) Network Analyst module introduced in ArcGIS Pro 2.4. This module stores intermediate network analyst data ```in_memory``` and promises to be [significantly faster](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/network-analyst/choosing-between-the-two-modules-arcpy-nax-versus-arcpy-na-.htm). To take advantage of this, the new 2.4 version of the *Accessibility Calculator* also stores its intermediate data ```in_memory``` and together these changes result in about a 25% improvement in speed versus the old version of the tool (this on a PC with an SSD - the savings will be even more dramatic with a spinning drive). However, if you are memory constrained, stick to the older version of the tool.
  - fixed an error related to assigning sequential IDs in the *batch calculator* for Pro introduced after updating to ArcGIS Pro 2.4
  - changed the ```search criteria``` and ```search query``` parameters to valueTables to make it much easier to specify search restrictions
  - changed the ```search tolerance``` parameters to proper linear unit data types
  - changed the ```departure time``` parameter to a proper datetime format for the Pro toolboxes
- ```v1.0``` original release alongside the paper in *Transport Findings*
